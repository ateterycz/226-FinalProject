# CSC 226 Web Database Applications - FinalProject

A prototype web application for a simulated car dealership. 

The database stores all car, order and authentication information used throughout the webpages.

The homepage shows a slideshow of the various cars for sale. Upon clicking the image of a car, a new page is loaded, allowing users to be prompted if they want to put in an order. Users must be logged in to allow purchasing a car. Password security is kept in mind with password hashing being used on account sign up.
